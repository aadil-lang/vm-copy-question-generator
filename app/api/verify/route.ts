⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL: YOU MUST SOLVE THE QUESTION COMPLETELY BEFORE VERIFYING ANYTHING ⚠️⚠️⚠️

QUESTION TO VERIFY:
${question}

${solution ? `PROVIDED SOLUTION:\n${solution}\n` : ''}

OPTIONS PROVIDED:
${options.map((opt: any, idx: number) => 
  `${String.fromCharCode(65 + idx)}. ${opt.text} ${opt.logic === 'CA' ? '(MARKED AS CORRECT ANSWER)' : `(Logic: ${opt.logic})`}`
).join('\n')}

${image ? `IMAGE DESCRIPTION:\n${image}\n` : ''}

MANDATORY VERIFICATION PROCESS (FOLLOW THESE STEPS IN ORDER):

STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION
- Read the question carefully and identify what is being asked
- Identify all given information, constraints, and conditions
- Determine what type of mathematical problem this is
- Check if the question is well-formed and unambiguous

STEP 2: SOLVE THE QUESTION COMPLETELY
- Solve the problem step-by-step from scratch
- Show ALL your work mentally (you don't need to write it, but think through it)
- Calculate the final answer carefully
- Verify your answer by plugging it back into the problem
- Check that your answer satisfies ALL conditions in the question
- Ensure your answer is in the correct format (fraction, decimal, whole number, etc.)

STEP 3: VERIFY THE MARKED CORRECT ANSWER
- Check which option is currently marked as "CA" (Correct Answer)
- Compare the marked CA option with your calculated answer
- If they match exactly (or are mathematically equivalent), the CA is correct
- If they don't match, the CA is WRONG and you must identify the correct option

STEP 4: VERIFY ALL OPTIONS INDIVIDUALLY
- For EACH option, check if it could be the correct answer:
  - Option A: Is this the correct answer? (Yes/No)
  - Option B: Is this the correct answer? (Yes/No)
  - Option C: Is this the correct answer? (Yes/No)
  - Option D: Is this the correct answer? (Yes/No)
  - (Continue for all options)
- Exactly ONE option should be correct
- ALL other options should be incorrect

STEP 5: VERIFY DISTRACTOR LOGIC AND OPTION VALUES
- For each incorrect option, check if the provided logic accurately describes why it's wrong
- IMPORTANT: Only flag option value/logic mismatches if they are MATHEMATICALLY SIGNIFICANT
- Minor discrepancies or alternative valid interpretations should NOT be flagged as errors
- Only correct option values if:
  * The logic clearly describes a specific error (e.g., "Used subtraction instead") AND
  * The current option value is clearly wrong (e.g., logic says "subtraction" but value is the addition result)
  * The mismatch would confuse students or make the question invalid
- If the logic is reasonable and the option is clearly incorrect (even if not perfectly matching the logic description), do NOT change it
- Be conservative: Only change things when there are clear mathematical errors, not stylistic differences

STEP 6: VERIFY THE QUESTION ITSELF
- Check if the question has any mathematical errors
- Check if the question is solvable with the given information
- Check if there are any contradictions in the question
- Check if the question is unambiguous

STEP 7: VERIFY THE SOLUTION (if provided)
- Check if the provided solution correctly solves the problem
- Verify that the solution leads to the correct answer
- Check if the solution matches the correct option

STEP 8: VERIFY CONTEXT PRACTICALITY AND REASONABLENESS (FOR WORD PROBLEMS AND IMAGE-BASED QUESTIONS WITH CONTEXT)
${questionType === 'word-problems' || questionType === 'image-based' ? `- Check if the context/scenario is practical and reasonable:
  * Are the quantities realistic? (e.g., prices, speeds, ages, amounts, distances, time)
  * Are the timeframes logical? (e.g., can someone really do X in Y time?)
  * Are the ages appropriate for the activities described?
  * Are the scenarios believable and possible in real life?
  * Are units and measurements consistent and realistic?
  * Are the numbers appropriate for the grade level?
- Check for impractical scenarios:
  * ❌ "A student solving 200 problems in 5 minutes" (impossible - too fast)
  * ❌ "A 5-year-old driving a car" (age-inappropriate)
  * ❌ "Buying a house for $5" (unrealistic price - too low)
  * ❌ "Running 1000 miles per hour" (impossible speed)
  * ❌ "A person who is 200 years old" (unrealistic age)
  * ❌ "A 3rd grader solving calculus problems" (grade-inappropriate)
  * ❌ "Walking 500 miles in 1 hour" (impossible distance/time)
  * ❌ "A book costing $0.01" (unrealistic price for most books)
- Check for reasonable scenarios:
  * ✅ "A student solving 10 problems in 30 minutes" (reasonable pace)
  * ✅ "A 16-year-old learning to drive" (age-appropriate)
  * ✅ "Buying a book for $15" (realistic price)
  * ✅ "Running 6 miles per hour" (reasonable speed)
  * ✅ "A person who is 35 years old" (realistic age)
  * ✅ "A 5th grader solving multiplication problems" (grade-appropriate)
  * ✅ "Walking 3 miles in 1 hour" (reasonable distance/time)
  * ✅ "A toy costing $12.99" (realistic price)
- If context is impractical or unreasonable:
  * Set hasErrors: true
  * Add error: "Context is impractical/unreasonable: [description of specific issue]"
  * Add to contextIssues array: [detailed list of all context problems found]
  * Set contextCorrected: true
  * Provide corrected question with practical and reasonable context
  * Maintain the same mathematical structure and difficulty
  * Only change the context/scenario values, not the math problem itself
  * Ensure corrected values are:
    - Realistic and believable
    - Age-appropriate for the grade level
    - Consistent with real-world expectations
    - Mathematically equivalent (same problem type, same operations)
- Examples of context corrections:
  * "200 problems in 5 minutes" → "20 problems in 30 minutes" (maintains same rate concept)
  * "$5 for a house" → "$150,000 for a house" (realistic price)
  * "200 years old" → "35 years old" (realistic age)
  * "1000 mph" → "60 mph" (reasonable speed)
  * "A 3rd grader doing calculus" → "A 3rd grader doing addition" (grade-appropriate)
  * "500 miles in 1 hour" → "3 miles in 1 hour" (reasonable walking speed)` : '- Context verification: N/A (mathematical question without context)'}

CRITICAL ERROR DETECTION RULES:
1. If the marked CA is WRONG:
   - Set hasErrors: true
   - Add error: "Incorrect answer marked as correct. The correct answer is [option letter]."
   - Mark the actual correct option as "CA"
   - Keep the wrong option but update its logic to explain why it's wrong

2. If a distractor is actually correct:
   - Set hasErrors: true
   - Add error: "Option [letter] is marked as incorrect but is actually correct."
   - Replace that distractor with a new incorrect option
   - Provide appropriate logic for the new distractor

3. If the question has mathematical errors:
   - Set hasErrors: true
   - Add error: "Question contains mathematical error: [description]"
   - Provide corrected question text

4. If the solution doesn't match the correct answer:
   - Set hasErrors: true
   - Add error: "Solution does not match the correct answer."
   - Provide corrected solution

5. If distractor logic is inaccurate:
   - Set hasErrors: true
   - Add error: "Distractor logic for option [letter] is inaccurate."
   - Provide corrected logic
   - Ensure the option value matches the corrected logic

6. If an option value does not match its logic (ONLY FLAG IF MATHEMATICALLY SIGNIFICANT):
   - Only flag this if the mismatch is clear and would make the question confusing or invalid
   - Be conservative: If the option is clearly incorrect (even if not perfectly matching the logic), that's acceptable
   - Only set hasErrors: true if:
     * The logic describes a specific error AND
     * The current option value is clearly the correct answer (not just a different wrong answer)
     * The mismatch would make the question mathematically invalid
   - Examples of when to flag:
     * Logic: "Used subtraction instead" but option value is the correct answer → FLAG
     * Logic: "Used subtraction instead" but option value is a different wrong answer → DO NOT FLAG (acceptable)
     * Logic: "Calculation error" but option is clearly wrong → DO NOT FLAG (acceptable, even if not specific)
   - Only update option values if the current value is mathematically wrong in a way that contradicts the logic

7. If the context is impractical or unreasonable:
   - Set hasErrors: true
   - Set contextCorrected: true
   - Add error: "Context is impractical/unreasonable: [specific issue, e.g., 'Student solving 200 problems in 5 minutes is impossible']"
   - Add to contextIssues array: [detailed list of all context problems, e.g., "Quantity too high: 200 problems", "Time too short: 5 minutes", "Rate is unrealistic: 40 problems per minute"]
   - Provide corrected question with practical context
   - Ensure the corrected context:
     * Maintains the same mathematical problem structure
     * Uses realistic quantities, timeframes, and scenarios
     * Is age-appropriate for the grade level (if grade level can be inferred)
     * Is believable and possible in real life
     * Preserves the mathematical relationships (e.g., if original was about rate, corrected should also be about rate)
   - Example corrections:
     * "200 problems in 5 minutes" → "20 problems in 30 minutes" (maintains rate concept, more realistic)
     * "$5 for a house" → "$150,000 for a house" (realistic price)
     * "200 years old" → "35 years old" (realistic age)
     * "1000 mph" → "60 mph" (reasonable speed)
     * "A 3rd grader solving calculus" → "A 3rd grader solving addition" (grade-appropriate)
     * "500 miles in 1 hour" → "3 miles in 1 hour" (reasonable walking speed)
   - CRITICAL: Only change context values, NOT the mathematical structure or operations
   - CRITICAL: The corrected question should solve to the same type of answer (same units, same format)

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no markdown):
{
  "hasErrors": true/false,
  "errors": ["detailed list of all errors found"],
  "correctedQuestion": "corrected question text (only if question had errors, otherwise same as input)",
  "correctedOptions": [
    {"text": "option text", "logic": "CA" or "error description"},
    ...
  ],
  "correctedSolution": "corrected solution (only if solution had errors, otherwise same as input)",
  "contextCorrected": true/false,
  "contextIssues": ["list of context issues found, e.g., 'Quantity too high: 200 problems', 'Time too short: 5 minutes'"],
  "verificationNotes": "detailed explanation of verification process, what was checked, and any corrections made"
}

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- BE CONSERVATIVE: Only flag errors if there are ACTUAL mathematical mistakes or clear context issues, not minor discrepancies
- If the question is mathematically correct, context is reasonable, and the correct answer is properly marked: set "hasErrors": false
- If no errors are found: set "hasErrors": false and return original question/options/solution EXACTLY as provided (unchanged)
- Only set "hasErrors": true if there are clear mathematical errors or impractical context that need correction
- DO NOT change correct answers, solutions, or options just because they could be worded differently
- DO NOT change option values unless they are mathematically wrong (e.g., a distractor is actually correct)
- The "correctedOptions" array MUST have EXACTLY ${options.length} options (same as input) - DO NOT add or remove options
- Exactly ONE option MUST have "logic": "CA"
- If context was corrected: set "contextCorrected": true and populate "contextIssues" with detailed list of problems found
- If context was NOT corrected: set "contextCorrected": false and "contextIssues": []
- "verificationNotes" MUST include: "I solved the question and got [your answer]. The correct option is [letter]." If context was corrected, also mention: "Context was corrected for practicality: [brief summary]."
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown code blocks, no explanations outside JSON
- Be extremely careful and thorough - mathematical accuracy and context reasonableness are both critical
- CRITICAL: Maintain the exact same number of options - if you need to fix an option, replace it in place, do not add or remove options
- CONSERVATIVE APPROACH: When in doubt about mathematical correctness, do NOT change anything - only correct clear mathematical errors
- CONTEXT CORRECTION: Only correct context if it is clearly impractical or unreasonable - be conservative but thorough`
